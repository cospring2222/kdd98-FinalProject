| GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS (for DOWNLOADS, RESULT RETURNS, etc.)         | 
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

1. FTP to 159.127.66.10. Login anonymous. Enter email ID as password.

3. The README file contains information about the files included in
the FTP server.  All data files are compressed. The files with .zip
extension are compressed with the PKZIP compression utility and they
are for participants with IBM PC compatible hardware. The PKUNZIP
utility is needed to unzip these files. The files with .Z extension
are UNIX COMPRESSed and they are for the participants with UNIX
compatible hardware. YOU WILL EITHER NEED THE DATA FILES <cup98LRN.ZIP
AND cup98VAL.ZIP> *OR* <cup98LRN.TXT.Z AND cup98VAL.TXT.Z>, BUT NOT
BOTH. REMEMBER TO FTP THESE FILES IN BINARY MODE.

4. The data sets are in comma delimited format. The learning dataset
<cup98LRN.txt> contains 95412 records and 481 fields. The first/header
row of the data set contains the field names.

The validation dataset <cup98VAL.txt> contains 96367 records and 479
variables. The first/header row of the data set contains the field
names.

THE RECORDS IN THE VALIDATION DATASET ARE IDENTICAL TO THE RECORDS IN
THE LEARNING DATASET EXCEPT THAT THE VALUES FOR THE TARGET/DEPENDENT
VARIABLES ARE MISSING (i.e., the fields TARGET_B and TARGET_D are
not included in the validation data set.)

5. The data dictionary (for both the learning and the validation data
set) is included in the file <cup98DIC.txt>. The fields in the data
dictionary are ordered by the position of the fields in the learning
data set. The dictionary for the validation data set is identical to
the dictionary for the learning data set except the two target fields
(target_B and target_D) are missing in the validation data set.

6. Blanks in the string (or character) variables/fields and periods in
the numeric variables correspond to missing values.

7. Each record has a unique record identifier or index (field name:
CONTROLN.) For each record, there are two target/dependent variables
(field names: TARGET_B and TARGET_D). TARGET_B is a binary variable
indicating whether or not the record responded to the promotion of
interest ("97NK" mailing) while TARGET_D contains the donation amount
(dollar) and is only observed for those that responded to the
promotion.

8. THE DEADLINE HAS BEEN EXTENDED. You are required to return the
questionnaire and the validation dataset of 96367 records by email to
<iparsa@epsilon.com> by AUGUST 19, 1998.

Each record in the returned file should consist of the following two
values:

a. The unique record identifier or index (field name: CONTROLN)
b. Predicted value of the donation (dollar) amount (for the target
variable TARGET_D) for that record 

You are also required to fill out the questionnaire (file name:
<cup98QUE.txt>. The questionnaire is used to summarize in bullet
points the data analytic techniques you've applied to the dataset.

| PROJECT OVERVIEW: A Fund Raising Net Return Prediction Model       | 
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
-------------------------

The data set for this year's Cup has been generously provided by the
Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA).  PVA is a not-for-profit
organization that provides programs and services for US veterans with
spinal cord injuries or disease.  With an in-house database of over 13
million donors, PVA is also one of the largest direct mail fund
raisers in the country.

Participants in the '98 CUP will demonstrate the performance of their
tool by analyzing the results of one of PVA's recent fund raising
appeals.  This mailing was sent to a total of 3.5 million PVA donors
who were on the PVA database as of June 1997.  Everyone included in
this mailing had made at least one prior donation to PVA.

The mailing included a gift (or "premium") of personalized name &
address labels plus an assortment of 10 note cards and envelopes.  All
of the donors who received this mailing were acquired by PVA through
similar premium-oriented appeals such as this.

One group that is of particular interest to PVA is "Lapsed" donors.
These are individuals who made their last donation to PVA 13 to 24
months ago.  They represent an important group to PVA, since the
longer someone goes without donating, the less likely they will be to
give again.  Therefore, recapture of these former donors is a critical
aspect of PVA's fund raising efforts.

However, PVA has found that there is often an inverse correlation
between likelihood to respond and the dollar amount of the gift, so a
straight response model (a classification or discrimination task) will
most likely net only very low dollar donors.  High dollar donors will
fall into the lower deciles, which would most likely be suppressed
from future mailings.  The lost revenue of these suppressed donors
would then offset any gains due to the increased response rate of the
low dollar donors.

Therefore, to improve the cost-effectiveness of future direct
marketing efforts, PVA wishes to develop a model that will help them
maximize the net revenue (a regression or estimation task) generated
from future renewal mailings to Lapsed donors.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| EVALUATION RULES                                                   |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

Once again, the objective of the analysis will be to maximize the net
revenue generated from this mailing - a censored regression or
estimation problem. The response variable is, thus, continuous (for 
the lack of a better common term.) Alhough we are releasing both the
binary and the continuous versions of the target variable (TARGET_B
and TARGET_D respectively), the program committee will use the
predicted value of the donation (dollar) amount (for the target
variable TARGET_D) in evaluating the results. So, returning the
predicted value of the binary target variable TARGET_B and its
associated probability/strength will not be sufficient. 

The typical outcome of predictive modeling in database marketing is 
an estimate of the expected response/return per customer in the
database. A marketer will mail to a customer so long as the expected 
return from an order exceeds the cost invested in generating the order, 
i.e., the cost of promotion. For our purpose, the package cost 
(including the mail cost) is $0.68 per piece mailed.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| DATA SOURCES and ORDER & TYPE OF THE VARIABLES IN THE DATA SETS    |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

The dataset includes:

o 24 months of detailed PVA promotion and giving history (covering the
  period 12 to 36 months prior to the "97NK" mailing)

o A summary of the promotions sent to the donors over the most recent
  12 months prior to the "97NK" mailing (by definition, none of these
  donors responded to any of these promotions)

o Summary variables reflecting each donor's lifetime giving history
  (e.g., total # of donations prior to "97NK" mailing, total $ amount
  of the donations, etc.)

o Overlay demographics, including a mix of household and area level
  data

o All other available data from the PVA database (e.g., date of first
  gift, state, origin source, etc.)

The fields are described in greater detail in the data dictionary file
<filename: cup98DIC.txt>.

The name of the variables in the learning and validation data sets is
included in each file as the top (header) record. For your
information, they are listed below again (ordered by data set
position) along with the filed type information (Num: numeric, Char:
string/character.)

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| DATA (PRE)PROCESSING                                               |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

General 
-------

o The field CONTROLN is a unique record identifier (an index) and
should not be used in modeling

o Response flag (field name: TARGET_B) indicates whether or not the
lapsed donor responded to the campaign. THIS FIELD SHOULD NOT BE USED
DURING MODEL BUILDING.

o Blanks in string or character variables correspond to missing
values.  Periods and/or blanks in the numeric variables correspond to
missing values.

Data preprocessing tasks include the following:

Noisy Data
----------

Some of the fields in the analysis file may contain data entry and/or
formatting errors. You are expected to clean these fields (without
excluding the records.)

Records and Fields with Missing and Sparse Data
-----------------------------------------------

Discovery methods vary in the way they treat the missing values. While
some simply disregard missing values or omit the corresponding
records, others infer missing values from known values, or treat
missing data as a special value to be included additionally in the
attribute domain.

For the purposes of KDD-CUP-98 the records and/or fields should not be
omitted from analysis because they contain missing data. Instead, the
missing data should be inferred from known values (e.g., mean, median,
mode, a modeled value, or any other way supported by your tool.) One
exception to this rule is the attributes containing 99.5 percent or
more missings. You are expected to omit these attributes from the
analysis.

You are also expected to drop attributes with 'sparse'
distributions. Sparse data occur when the events actually represented
in given data make only a very small subset of the event space.

Fields Containing Constants
---------------------------

Fields containing a constant value (i.e., there is only one value for
all the records) should be dropped from the analysis. Attributes
containing missing and one valid level (e.g., 'Y') are not considered
as constants and should be included in the analysis.

Time Frame and Date Fields
--------------------------

This mailing was mailed to a total of 3.5 million PVA donors who were
on the PVA database as of June 1997. All information contained in the
analysis dataset reflects the donor status prior to 6/97 (except the
gift receipt dates, which will follow the promotion dates.) This date
could be used as the "end date" or "rerefence date" in the calculation
of "number of months since" variables.

ATTRIBUTE TYPE
--------------

See the data dictionary to determine the attribute types.

o This file contains the target fields that were left out of the 
  validation data set that was sent to the KDD-CUP-98 participants. 
  These fields were used by the KDD-CUP-98 Committee to evaluate the 
  accuracy of the predictions submitted by the participants. 
 
o The file is in comma delimited format and contains 96,367 records 
  and the following 3 fields: 

  CONTROLN     Control number (unique record identifier)

  TARGET_B     Target Variable: Binary Indicator for Response to the 
               97NK Mailing

  TARGET_D     Target Variable: Donation Amount (in $) associated 
               with the Response to the 97NK Mailing

  The first/header row of the file contains the field names.

o The field CONTROLN will be used as the match key to merge these
  3 fields into the original validation data set (file name:
  cup98VAL.txt)

[TERMINOLOGY-GLOSSARY]

o DATA PREPROCESSING or PREPARATION includes data clean-up,
  elimination of unusable variables, treating missing values and DATA
  TRANSFORMATIONS such as adding new variables, performing
  calculations on existing variables, creating interaction variables,
  grouping continuous variables into ranges and managing categorical
  variables in different ways, etc.

o EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) provides a preliminary view of the
  data set in a univariate (one variable at a time), bivariate (two
  variables at a time) or multivariate sense (more than two variables
  at a time). EDA, as used below, describes the search for patterns,
  relationships or functional dependencies that are not attributable
  to chance.

o DATA MINING is often used as a synonym for KDD. For our purposes,
  data mining is a step in the overall knowledge discovery process.
  It refers to a class of methods/algorithms used to extract
  patterns from data.  

o The process of KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY and the process of DATA ANALYSIS
  and MODELING are used synonymously.

o ATTRIBUTE, FIELD, VARIABLE and FEATURE are synonyms.

o RECORDS, CASES, OBSERVATIONS and EXAMPLES are synonyms.

o SPARSE DATA are when the events actually represented in a given
  datum make only a very small subset of the event space. They become
  harder to spot and summarize in a pattern. This is sometimes called
  small volume data.

o NOISY DATA contain errors due to the nature of data collection, data
  entry or formatting errors.

o MISSING DATA happen when values for some records and attributes are
  missing because they were not measured, not answered or simply lost.

o A BALANCED DATA SET is a data set which contains a similar number of
  examples from each class that the algorithm is trying to predict.

o An ARTIFICIALLY EXTENDED or INFLATED DATA SET is when the records
  that represent the class with a relatively tiny number of examples
  have been replicated on purpose to balance the data set.

o ANALYSIS FILE, ANALYSIS SAMPLE and, LEARNING AND VALIDATION FILES 
  COMBINED represent the same entity. 

o ATTRIBUTE or VARIABLE TYPE characterizes the type of values in the
  set of possible values of an attribute. An attribute can be nominal,
  ordinal, interval, continuous and so forth.

o CATEGORICAL VARIABLES represent nominal and ordinal variables. 

o FEATURE SUBSET SELECTION and VARIABLE SELECTION are used
  synonymously.

o FEATURE REDUNDANCY or (MULTI)COLLINEARITY exists when the columns of
  a data matrix are linearly or very close to being linearly dependent
  such that it is possible to express some variables as a function of
  others. This also called FUNCTIONAL RELATION.

o The SCORING CODE is a stand alone C, C++ or other programming
  language callable program or hard code that carries out all the
  steps required to implement the learning algorithm outside the model
  building environment. It is ultimately used in computing the
  predicted value or output from raw data. In addition to the rules or
  the numeric values of the weights, the scoring code also includes
  preprocessing statements for data treatment. For the decision tree
  algorithms, for example, the data preprocessing code along with
  the 'if-then-else' rules constitutes the scoring code.

o LIFT TABLES or LIFT CHARTS (a.k.a. gains charts or tables) are used
  in the field of database marketing to evaluate the performance of
  predictive models and to make marketing decisions. The term 'lift'
  implies improvement over random targeting or no targeting at all and
  computed as follows:

  1. Sort the file representing the market to which the algorithm will
     be applied by descending order of the predicted probability/score
     or output.

  2. Split the sorted file into 10 or 20 equally sized groups (in terms
     of frequency count) based on the number of records. The resulting
     groups or quantiles are called deciles or demi-deciles,
     respectively.

  3. Compute the percent of targets in each decile or demi-decile.

  4. The ratio of the percent of targets in each decile or demi-decile
     to the percent of targets in the file provides the lift. 

  5. The cumulative lift or the cumulative percent of responders is
     the cumulative count of the responders up to each decile or
     demi-decile.

  Usually, RMS error, correlation or classification table results are
  all proportional to the cumulative lift. It is not unusual to have
  the highest lift not be the highest RMS, correlation or
  classification rate.
 
  For the calculation of the lift in the case of a continuous target
  variable, please refer to the Evaluation Rules section of the 
  KDD-CUP documentation <file name: cup98DOC.txt>.

o RESPONDERS refer to TARGETS.

o NON-REPONDERS refer to NON-TARGETS. 

o TARGET and DEPENDENT VARIABLE are synonyms.

o OUTPUT, PREDICTED PROBABILITY and PREDICTED SCORE are used
  synonymously.

o INPUTS, INDEPENDENT VARIABLES and PREDICTORS are synonyms.

o WEIGHTS are the same as COEFFICIENTS.
