KDD-CUP-98   final project by  Uliana Zeigman.

oficial data in folder: AditionalInfo

Problem Statement and Idea: 
The goal of the problem is to maximize net profit from a marketing campaign for fundraising. Since the response rate is low (about 5 percent), it is necessary to devise a strategy to identify profitable candidates. Given a candidate-member x, to predict:

1. whether x will donate? (Clasification)
2. what amount will x donate? (Regresion, not implemented yet)

Files description:
1. Data ingestion and preprocessing:
DataExplAndPrep.ipynb
2. Clasification Models(MLPClassifier and  LogisticRegression):  
ClassificationModel.ipynb
3. Test set scoring:
TestSetScoreCalc.ipynb

Conclusion
In this investigation LogisticRegression winning.

Future goals
There is  many ideas to check others methods for models and feature ingenering, 
Is still missing result comparison visualisation.
Regression models.
